## Markov Poem Generator Web App

This project implements a fun and creative Markov poem generator web application! Users can input their own text, and the app uses Python's Flask framework to create poems in a similar style using Markov chains. The HTML, CSS, and JavaScript frontend provides a user-friendly interface for text input and displaying the generated poems.

**Key Features:**

* User-provided text inspires poem generation.
* Poems are created using the Markov chain algorithm for a unique and stylistic output.
* Interactive interface for easy text input and poem display.

**Technical Stack:**

* Backend: Python (Flask)
* Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

**How to Use:**

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install required dependencies (likely Flask).
3. Run the Flask application using `python app.py`.
4. Open http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (or your local development server address) in your web browser.
5. Enter your text in the text area and click the "Generate Poem" button.
6. The generated poem will be displayed below the text area.

**Feel free to experiment with different text inputs and adjust the poem generation parameters (order, length) in the Python code.**
